* Introduction
pCloud is a cloud storage provider.
* Installation
Download the binary from [[https://www.pcloud.com/download-free-online-cloud-file-storage.html][the pCloud website]]. I like to organize my files so, download it into your home directory, maybe into a directory called =~/apps/pcloud=.

Next we have to create a menu item. In KDE, we need to open KMenuEdit, so right mouse button on the application launcher menu, click Edit Applications... to start KMenuEdit. Now create a "New Item" and populate the fields. If you want a logo to be displayed download it, I downloaded the png from [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pcloud-logo.svg][wikimedia]] and placed it in my pcloud directory. Save your changes, enjoy!
