* Introduction
Nim is a relatively new programming language with syntax similar to python, macros similar to a lisp and best yet, compiles down to C.
* Installation
** Dependencies
Ensure GCC is installed
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt install build-essential
#+END_SRC
I also want the Clang compiler too, so we can take advantage of LLVM
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt install clang cmake clang-format libclang-dev
#+END_SRC
** Install choosenim
=choosenim= is a tool similar to =pyenv= which allows you to have multiple versions of nim installed on your computer and switch between them, fairly seamlessly.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh
#+END_SRC
** Adding nim to your PATH
Remember to add nim to our path
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
export PATH=~/.nimble/bin:$PATH
#+END_EXAMPLE
