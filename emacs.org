* Install Newest Emacs
Emacs in most repositories is pretty stale, let's install from source.
** Empower Apt to View and Operate on Source Code
Before we get started we need to ensure that we toggle on =Source code= as an option for =apt= to download from the internet. To do this open the program =software-properties-=. Note the dash (-) at the end, please use the one available on your system, this will differ based on your desktop environment. 

*Note* that you may have to run this as sudo.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo software-properties-kde
#+END_SRC

The following will be presented to you. Enable the checkbox "Source code" and save.

Set a build directory
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
EMACS_BUILD_DIR=~/Downloads
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git $EMACS_BUILD_DIR/emacs
#+END_SRC
Checkout the version you wish to build

#+END_SRC
